tested on all major browsers including Firefox 2 &amp; 3.6, Opera 9.5
&amp; 10, Internet Explorer 7 &amp; 8 and Safari 3.2.Your browser
should have JavaScript enabled to make this theme work! For example,
the DropDown Navigation and the Content Slider need Javascript to

<P>The theme works on WordPress 3.1.3 without any problems. Previous
versions have not been tested and are not supported. Make sure to
update your WordPress installation, especially to protect yourself
from security flaws.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Theme Installation</H3>
<P>Upload the theme files to your WordPress theme folder
wp-content/themes and activate the theme in your WordPress admin
panel. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Plugins Installation</H3>
<P>If you are using the theme as a dictionary, you will need the
following plugins:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>You will need the WordPress plugin <A HREF="http://pathway.sil.org/webonary/download/?did=2">SIL
	Dictionary Infrastructure</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>Assuming you have a bilingual or multilingual dictionary, you
	will also need to download, install, and activate <A 	HREF="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/">qTranslate</A>.</P>
	<LI><P><P>For showing page numbers instead of "Previous/Next entries" below the search results, 	you might want to make use of <A HREF="http://www.jenst.se/2008/03/29/wp-page-numbers">WP
	Page Numbers</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>If you allow people to comment on your pages or entries, you

	Quiz.</P>

plugin support inherited from the base theme.</P>
<P>The following notes come from the zeeDisplay author:</P>

		but here is where you decide whether you want allow people to
		comment on your pages or entries. If you don't, uncheck &ldquo;Allow

		other options.</P>
		<LI><P>Select Media. Near the bottom, uncheck &ldquo;Organize my

			code via the theme option panel. All styles are stored in the
			folder /includes/styles. There is a CSS file and a image folder
			for each color, which you can manually change or even add new
			ones. So you have the opportunity to create individual and
			unlimited skins for your theme. Have fun!&rdquo;</P>
			<LI><P>If you want to use the Featured Post Slider, check the box.
			This could be a useful feature. For example, if you are making

<H3 CLASS="western">Pages</H3>
<P>You will most likely need some pages that has information about
your site. For example, most sites have a Contact page. Add these
pages in the Pages area.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Menus</H3>
<P>This theme supports two menus, a top menu and a main menu. You'll
probably want to arrange your pages in the main menu.</P>
<P>The top menu can be handy for multiple language support. For
example, suppose you have Spanish and English in your dictionary.
When you select Spanish, the site changes to a Spanish interface, and
when you select English, it changes to an English interface. In the
Menus area, you can create a Custom Link for each language name. Put
the link for the site in Spanish: <A HREF="http://www.MyDictionary.org/">www.MyDictionary.org</A>.
Then put the link for the English version:
<A HREF="http://www.MyDictionary.org/">www.MyDictionary.org</A>?lang=en.</P>
